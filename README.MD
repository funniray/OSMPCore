# OSMP  
## What is OSMP?  
OSMP stands for Open Source Minecraft Platform.  
This is a platform that hopes to be on almost every Nukkit minigame server.  
This plugin should help develop minigames for the Nukkit platform.  
## Sounds great, how do I start?  
Currently, there are no builds availible and I probably won't make builds myself  
Why? I feel like if you're going to make a minigame server then you should atleast maintain it and build your own tools.  
## Examples  
Currently there are no examples, these are yet to come!
